🔹 Project Preview

The Crop and Soil Recommendation System is designed to help identify the most suitable crop based on given soil and environmental conditions. Using a dataset from CASL, the project applies data preprocessing, analysis, and a machine learning model to generate accurate crop recommendations.

📌 Results and Output

The system provides a high level of accuracy in predicting crops. It shows overall accuracy, detailed performance for each crop, and a confusion matrix to visualize correct and incorrect predictions. Users can also enter soil nutrient values and environmental conditions manually to get a recommended crop instantly.

🌱 Factors Affecting Recommendations

The prediction is influenced by several agricultural factors:

Nitrogen (N): Improves growth and yield.

Phosphorus (P): Aids root development and flowering.

Potassium (K): Increases disease resistance and crop quality.

Soil pH: Determines nutrient absorption efficiency.

Temperature: Impacts germination and crop cycles.

Humidity: Affects plant growth and water balance.

Rainfall: Provides necessary water for cultivation.


🔧 Features

The model uses soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall as input features, while the target output is the name of the recommended crop.
