ðŸŒŸ Project Review: Crop and Soil Recommendation System

This project focuses on building a Crop and Soil Recommendation System that combines data science and agriculture to support better farming decisions. The main objective is to suggest the most suitable crop for a given set of soil and climatic conditions, thereby promoting precision farming and sustainable agriculture.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features

1. Dataset Integration: Uses CASL dataset with essential parameters like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.


2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Identifies relationships between soil nutrients, weather, and crop yield patterns.


3. Machine Learning Model: Implements a Random Forest algorithm for robust and accurate predictions.


4. Visualization: Correlation heatmaps and confusion matrices provide clear insights into data and model performance.


5. User-Friendly Prediction: A function allows users to input real soil and environmental values to get an instant crop recommendation.



ðŸ“Š Outcomes

Achieves high prediction accuracy on test data.

Provides recommendations tailored to environmental and soil conditions.

Supports informed decisions for farmers and researchers to maximize productivity.


âœ… What Has Been Done

Collected and prepared the dataset.

Preprocessed data and performed feature analysis.

Trained and evaluated the machine learning model.

Built a recommendation function for practical usage.


ðŸŒ± Overall Review

The project successfully demonstrates how artificial intelligence and agriculture can work together to solve real-world problems. By transforming soil and climate data into actionable insights, this system provides reliable crop recommendations, improves efficiency in agriculture, and highlights the impact of data-driven decision-making in farming practices.
